## Update V0.10.1
### Bugfixes
* Changed blueprint compatibility for a lot of Jokers, meaning they should now work correctly with blueprint.
    - The full list of Jokers that got changed with regards to blueprint is: Cultist, Lucky Number Seven, Delayed Jokers, Showoff, Sniper, Blackjack, Batman, Grudgeful, Historical, Shy joker, Abbey Road, Rigged, What Are The Odds, Stockpiler, Checklist and One Of Us.
* Fixed Incomplete Joker stretching on reload.
### Balance changes
* Showoff Joker now gains X0.25 Mult instead of X1 Mult.
* Jokers For Hire deck now has a X2 linear cost increase, instead of an exponential one. Example: 2nd joker will cost X4 the base price, 3rd joker will cost X6 the base price, etc.
    - Riff-raff now costs $1.000.000.000.
### Other
* Changed Jokers (where applicable) to use in game functions to pick random editions, to be more in line with the base game, this means the odds will be the same as the base game as well instead of being evenly spread.
* Now uses the updated joker API for setting the local variables used in localization. This means Steamodded V0.8.2 is **required**.s
