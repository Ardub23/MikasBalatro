## Update V0.11.0
### New Jokers
* Pack A Punch: Give the left-most Joker a random Edition when a blind is selected, at the cost of $20. This will replace the current Edition. It also self destructs if it replaces a negative Edition and there are too many Jokers.
* Seal Stealer:  Trigger Purple and Blue seals when they are scored. This works with Harp Seal as well as Planetary Alignment (now Aurora Borealis).
* Tax Collector: Gives $1, $2, $3 or $4 per Joker at the end of the round, based on their rarity.
* Glass Cannon: Retrigger all glass cards, but they are guaranteed to break.
* Scoring Test: If played hand scores less than 1% of blind chip requirement, destroy it.
* Cicero: All Jokers that do not give Mult, Chips or retriggers will be negative in the shop.
### New Tarots
* The Idiot: Multiply your money by -1.
* Fortune: Has a 3/4 chance to double your money with no cap, otherwise set your money to $0.
### New Spectrals
* Bribe: Turn a random Joker Negative but lose $50, ignoring the spending limit.
### Resprites

### Other
* Harp Seal now works with Planetary Alignment (now Aurora Borealis).
* Added a Mod Badge, so Steamodded V0.9.7 is required.
## Update V0.10.1
### Bugfixes
* Changed blueprint compatibility for a lot of Jokers, meaning they should now work correctly with blueprint.
    - The full list of Jokers that got changed with regards to blueprint is: Cultist, Lucky Number Seven, Delayed Jokers, Showoff, Sniper, Blackjack, Batman, Grudgeful, Historical, Shy joker, Abbey Road, Rigged, What Are The Odds, Stockpiler, Checklist and One Of Us.
* Fixed Incomplete Joker stretching on reload.
### Balance changes
* Showoff Joker now gains X0.25 Mult instead of X1 Mult.
* Jokers For Hire deck now has a linear cost increase, instead of an exponential one. Example: 2nd joker will cost the base price X2, 3rd joker will cost the base price X3, etc.
    - Riff-raff now costs $1.000.000.000.
### Other
* Changed Jokers (where applicable) to use in game functions to pick random editions, to be more in line with the base game, this means the odds will be the same as the base game as well instead of being evenly spread.
* Now uses the updated joker API for setting the local variables used in localization. This means Steamodded V0.8.2 is **required**.
