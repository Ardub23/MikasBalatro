# Mika's Balatro Mod Collection
This is my mod collection for the game [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/), containing 51 Jokers, 2 Tarots, 1 Spectral and 7 Decks.

# Mod Incompatibility
### JellyMod
This mod is partially incompatible with JellyMod, but there is a partial workaround. As long as you extract JellyMod into a seperate subfolder and keep MikasModCollection inside of the Mods folder, they should be mostly compatible. Your final Mods folder should look something like this: `Appdata/Balatro/Mods` will have `MikasModCollection.lua` and the `assets` folder. Put the JellyMod zip in a new folder `Appdata/Balatro/Mods/JellyMod`, and then extract `JellyMod.zip` there. The Scout Joker from JellyMod breaks things again, but things should be more compatible than before.\
_Thanks to `@Mastahcheech` and `@Cr4zZyBipBiip` for figuring this out_
### Divvy's Real-Time Score Preview
This mod is also incompatible with Divvy's, with no possible fix.

# Installation
- Requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/) version 0.9.5 or higher.
